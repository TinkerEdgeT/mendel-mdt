mendel-development-tool (1.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Reworked how mDNS discoveries are done.
  * Make the shell command respect requested IP addresses.
  * Stop trying to scan for devices after construction of the Discoverer.
  * Add pushkey and setkey to help with key management.
  * Disable warnings from Python 3.5 about deprecated sign and verify
    functions. They're confusing, noisy, and content-free.
  * Update man pages.
  * Add a resetkeys subcommand to remove MDT keys and restart
    mdt-keymaster.
