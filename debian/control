Description: simple tool to work with single board computers running Mendel Linux
 MDT is a simple tool to aid in working with single board computers that the
 Mendel Linux distribution runs on. It consists of a whole bunch of
 pre-existing open source tooling, coupled with some simple wrappers written in
 python to ease their use.
 .
 It also provides an easy way to interact with these boards without having to
 fight with serial consoles, IP addresses, and other fiddly bits, reducing
 barrier to entry when working with these boards.
